# Download Google Street Panoramas

This project is aims to estimate the shade provision of the street trees using publicly 
accessible Google Street View panoramas and building height model in Boston. The method
can also be applied to other cities considering the massively available of Google Street
View service and the building height model information

For more details about the method check the paper Li and Ratti, "Mapping the spatial distribution of shade provision of street trees in Boston using Google Street View panoramas", Urban Forestry and Urban Greening.
